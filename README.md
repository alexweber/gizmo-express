> An opinionated Express API server starter using Typescript and Mongoose.

### Features
* 100% Typescript
* Built for an Angular 2+ backend
* Smart [config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) management
* Comprehensive test-suite with 150+ tests and >90% code coverage

### Caveats
* Waiting on Angular 4 + Universal updates before integrating it
* Typescript compilation into /dist/src and /dist/test is fugly, maybe Angular 4 CLI will have a solution?
* Not actually used in production yet, TDD all the way
