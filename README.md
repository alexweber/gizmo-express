# Gizmo Express

> An opinionated started for an Express API using Typescript and Mongoose.

### Features
* 100% Typescript
* Built for an Angular 2 backend server
* Comprehensive, full test-suite with 100+ tests and >80% code coverage

### Caveats
* Waiting on Angular 4 + Universal updates before integrating it
* Typescript compilation into /dist dir shouldn't include tests, maybe Angular 4 CLI will have a solution
